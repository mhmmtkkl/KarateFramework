Karate Framework

    URL(URI) is an end point.

    Postman is for manual API.

    Automation I am using rest assured libraries.

    Pojo - Dealing with JAVA

    Karate framework

        Cucumber with rest assured libraries.

        It is easier to automation API easier saving the time from JAVA code.

        Easy to understand.



    Can you tell me about your API testing after requirements?

        I do not know the end point.

        When we start working on the API user story. First developer is working on the story and after he done with it.
        Developer is giving me the story.

            While developer give the story he should provide these information: end point, parameters rules(if there is)
            According to these information.
            First I am testing in the postman(manual API)
            If it is passing
            Then I am testin in the Automation.

            After I am done with testing I am providing my screen shots and results in the JIRA.
